# Frontend Coding Guidance

- Always familiarize yourself with the tailwindcss themes and favor theme classes to direct tailwind classes
- You should never be using direct color classes or style definitions within components; always favor adding new layers or theme elements and use those
- Be extremely thoughtful and strategic about state management. Always favor React hooks (useReducer, useContext, etc.) to manage complexity
